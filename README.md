# Data Logger: Temperature, Pressure, Humidity, Light Intensity and Color

## Summary:

This is an open-source data logger that can record air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, visible light instensity, near-infrared light intensity, and visible light color (RGB).  This data logger can record at up to 1 Hz onto a FAT32 formatted SD card.  At 1Hz and with a full battery pack (6 AAs) the data logger should run for 200+ days on a single pack (depending on the SD card), with lower sampling frequencies increasing the duration to a maximum of greater than 833 days depending on the SD card used.  The light sensors employ an autogain feature with the intensity sensor having a 600,000,000:1 dynamic range, and a minimum sensitivity at about 1.0 nW/cm2.
